`alert` wraps a chunk of markdown in a styled callout. Use it for tips,
warnings, and tagged statements that should stand out from the surrounding
text. The shortcode accepts a `color` and an optional `title`. Nested markdown
inside the shortcode body is rendered normally.

## Parameters

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `color` | No | `primary` | Visual variant. Use `info`, `warning`, `label`, or `primary`. The same value is used to look up the SVG icon at `assets/icons/icon-alert-<color>.svg`. |
| `title` | No | — | Optional heading rendered above the body. Inline HTML is allowed. |

The body of the shortcode supports full markdown.

## Variants

### Info

Use `color="info"` for friendly, non-blocking notes.

```markdown
{{</* alert color="info" title="Note" */>}}
MongoDB is primarily designed for transactional workloads, not analytical
ones. The [MongoDB Connector](https://www.gooddata.ai/docs/cloud/) makes it
possible to use MongoDB with GoodData, but its performance depends on how the
data is modelled and processed. Set the data source `type` to `MONGODB`.
{{</* /alert */>}}
```

### Warning

Use `color="warning"` for breaking changes, beta features, or anything that
needs visual urgency.

```markdown
{{</* alert color="warning" title="Beta Feature" */>}}
GoodData's API solution is currently a **beta feature** and is still under
active development. Avoid calling `/api/v1` endpoints in production.
See the [API documentation](https://www.gooddata.ai/docs/cloud/) for details.
{{</* /alert */>}}
```

### Label

Use `color="label"` for high-contrast, branded statements.

```markdown
{{</* alert color="label" title="Heads up" */>}}
This article is part of the GoodData onboarding track.
{{</* /alert */>}}
```
